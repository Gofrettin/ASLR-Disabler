## :open_book: Project Overview :
ASLR Disabler is a little utility to disable PE ASLR by just drag and drop the PE file.  
The UI of ASLR Disabler is based on one of my other project, [ImGUI Standalone](https://github.com/adamhlt/ImGui-Standalone).

The start of goal of this project was to easily disable ASLR on PE dumps, to make them run.

ASLR Disabler works with x86 and x64 PE.
